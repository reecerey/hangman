# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! Test your word-guessing skills and see if you can save the hangman from his fate.

## Rules of the Game

Hangman is a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or when the hangman is fully drawn.

### How to Play

1. The game displays a series of dashes, representing the letters in the word you need to guess.

2. Click on the alphabet buttons to guess letters. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position. If not, the hangman will begin to take shape.

3. Try to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn! You have a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses.

4. You win the game if you correctly guess the word before the hangman is complete. You lose if the hangman is fully drawn.

5. After winning or losing, you have the option to play again with a new word.
